Learning Vector Quantization ( or LVQ ) is a type of Artificial Neural Network which also inspired by biological models of neural systems. It is based on a prototype supervised learning classification algorithm and trained its network through a competitive learning algorithm similar to Self Organizing Map.

In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects. In the simplest case, these objects are just finitely many points in the plane (called seeds, sites, or generators).
